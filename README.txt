==================== GIT INSTALLATION ====================

If you do not have git installed, please see the below link. Please note, it is not necessary to set up the SSH Keys. This is only needed if you are going to create a repository of your own on github.com.

Once you have git installed, simply visit the Moodle mod directory and clone git://github.com/markn86/moodle-mod_certificate.git, remember to rename the folder to certificate if you do not specify this in the clone command

Eg. Linux command line would be as follow -

git clone git://github.com/markn86/moodle-mod_certificate.git certificate

Use git pull to update this repository periodically to ensure you have the latest version.
